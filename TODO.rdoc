* MAYBE download into different buckets? So that I can get podcasts without waiting for, say, a big linux distro.
* Use rsync's --remove-source-files option so I don't have to clean up myself; but need a nice way to update the cache...
* Add (and remove?) asynchronously.
* MAYBE this might be a fun time to play with writing a Net::Rsync. But that would most definitely turn into a big project.
* Automatically strip the query-string off the end of filenames. (NPR podcasts are bad in this way.)
